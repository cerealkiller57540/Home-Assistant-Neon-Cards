"""Map a picture mode to the remote key that selects it locally.

Samsung TVs accept a handful of dedicated remote keys that jump straight to a
picture mode. That is the only path left when the SmartThings cloud refuses
``setPictureMode`` — which happens on models whose cloud link cannot actuate
them (#197) and on HDMI sources with content protection.

Matching is deliberately layered, most reliable first:

1. **The internal mode id** (``modeStandard``, ``modeDynamic``, …). Identical in
   every language, so this is the answer whenever the TV exposes
   ``supportedPictureModesMap``.
2. **The display name, normalised.** Many TVs — including every model that only
   offers ``custom.picturemode`` — expose no id map at all, leaving the
   localized name as the only handle. Accents and case are stripped and the
   name is matched on a *prefix*, because Samsung's translations of the same
   four modes overwhelmingly share a stem: Dynamic / Dynamique / Dynamisch /
   Dynamisk / Dinamico / Dinâmico / Dinamik / Dynamiczny / Dynamický all begin
   with ``dynam`` or ``dinam``. Exact per-language tables were tried first and
   failed exactly where they were needed: a Slovak TV (#197) and a Norwegian
   one (#206) each got a key for only the one mode that happened to be spelled
   like English.

Two deliberate refusals, because sending the wrong mode is worse than sending
none:

* **FILMMAKER MODE** has no remote key, and contains "film" — it must be
  rejected before the movie rule, or it would silently select Movie.
* **Natural** has no key of its own. The legacy table mapped it to the *Movie*
  key; that is preserved for the exact English word so existing setups do not
  change behaviour, but it is deliberately not extended to other languages.
